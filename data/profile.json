Apart from tech, I’m really into science and astronomy—learning about stars, galaxies, and the crazy physics that keeps the universe running.\n\nWhen I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me watching sci-fi series, horror movies, or anime, playing badminton, or experimenting in the kitchen because I genuinely enjoy cooking. I’m a big fan of cats and pandas, try to stay calm and patient in most situations, and I like being helpful to others.
