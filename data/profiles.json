I enjoy breaking complicated logic into simple stuff and then building it back in a smarter way. I explore core computer science concepts mostly out of curiosity. Apart from tech, I’m really into science and astronomy—learning about stars, galaxies, and the crazy physics that keeps the universe running.\n\nWhen I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me watching sci-fi series, horror movies, or anime, playing badminton, or experimenting in the kitchen because I genuinely enjoy cooking. I’m a big fan of cats and pandas, try to stay calm and patient in most situations, and I like being helpful to others. I’m always enthusiastic about learning, growing, and providing real value wherever I can.",
